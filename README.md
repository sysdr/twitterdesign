# Hands-On Twitter System Design

## Course Details

## Build Production-Ready Social Media Architecture From Scratch
### Why This Course?

Most system design courses teach you to draw boxes on whiteboards. This course teaches you to build systems that actually work. While others focus on theoretical concepts, you'll construct a complete Twitter-like platform handling millions of users, experiencing real bottlenecks and implementing proven solutions.

**The Reality Gap:** Fresh graduates can explain CAP theorem but struggle when their first production system crashes under 1,000 concurrent users. Senior engineers know their local patterns but freeze when designing global distribution. This course bridges that gap through progressive complexity - you'll start with 1,000 users and scale to 10 million, experiencing every architectural decision point.

**Career Acceleration:** System design expertise separates senior engineers from architects. Companies like Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb pay $200K+ premiums for engineers who understand distributed systems at scale. This course provides that expertise through hands-on implementation, not theoretical knowledge.

**Production Experience Without Risk:** Learn from 20+ years of hyperscale failures and optimizations compressed into practical exercises. You'll implement the exact patterns used by Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok without waiting years to encounter these challenges.

## What Makes This Course Different?

**Code-First Learning:** Every concept includes working implementation. No abstract diagrams without corresponding code. You'll debug real performance issues and implement actual solutions.

**Progressive Complexity:** Each week increases system scale by 10x, mimicking natural growth patterns. You'll experience the exact decision points that force architectural evolution in production systems.

**Mathematical Foundations:** Unlike courses relying on rules of thumb, you'll learn queuing theory for capacity planning, statistical methods for optimization, and failure mathematics for reliability engineering.

**Production-Hardened Patterns:** Every solution comes from real systems at companies like Netflix (chaos engineering), Google (global distribution), LinkedIn (social media scaling), and Amazon (distributed databases).

**Visual-First Understanding:** Complex concepts become intuitive through interactive diagrams, real-time monitoring visualizations, and failure scenario animations.

**Immediate Application:** Every lesson produces artifacts you can use in current projects. Students report immediate impact on their work within days of each session.

**Industry Mentorship:** Direct access to senior engineers from FAANG companies who've built these systems in production.
